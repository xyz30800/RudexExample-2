Contianer:

	A container is a react component that has a dirct connection to the state managed by redux.

	A container is a component that has direct access to the state that's produced by redux.

	In general we use the most parent component that care about a particular piece of state to be a container.

	Only the most parent component that uses a particular piece of state needs to be connected to redux.

{ Data container in the application } -> Redux
 + 
{ Views container in the application } -> React
 = 
{ Usable App } -> React - Redux

Action creator:

	When event is triggered, it's going to call an action creator.

	A action creator is a function that returns an action. An Action is an object that flows thought all of different reducers inside of appliction. Reducer can use that action to produce a different value for its particular piece of state.  

	Reducer can choose depending on the action to return a different piece of state depending on what action is.
